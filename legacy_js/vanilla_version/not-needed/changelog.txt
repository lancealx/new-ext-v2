*************************** Releases ********************************
9/24/2024 - Published version 0.7.4
    > Added feature to monitor url changes and reload toolbar if the appid changes.
    > Added toolbar to loan application page.


9/22/2024 - Published Version 0.7.3
    Added kills switch config.json file. It's on google cloud developer nano toolbar bucket
    I had to turn off caching.

9/21/2024 - Published version 0.7.2
    Cut out all listening of api calls and instead load toolbar on initial loan open. 
    Then only by refresh button after that. This creates a problem. When the user 
    types a new AppID into the url the toolbar does not update. It will show old data 
    from previous loan. Need to add logic to call main() when a new AppID is detected in the URL.
    But not cause a loop where main() is continually called.

    Jeff said Ember stores all data in memory. Going to make a new version of the ext which 
    looks at that store, will need to inject a script into the page to do so.


9/1/2024 - Published version 0.7.
    Added Appraisal status logic and conditional formatting
