**Last Updated**: Completed Phase 1.3 - Admin Dashboard & State Management
**Progress**: 4/120+ major services completed (TokenService, LicenseService, UserService, AnalyticsService)
**Major Accomplishment**: Complete admin dashboard for license management and user activity tracking integrated into Chrome extension

## 📊 **User Activity Logging Recommendations**

Based on the `/nano/users?currentOnly=true` API response, here's what we should track:

### **Core User Data to Capture**
```json
{
  "userId": "1523",
  "firstName": "David", 
  "lastName": "Alexander",
  "nickName": "Lance",
  "permissions": [4, 13, 14, 28, 55, 85, 96, 120, 129, 142, 148, 172, 183, 240, 80],
  "sessionStart": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z"
}
```

### **Activity Types to Log**
1. **Loan Interactions**
   - Loan ID accessed
   - Time spent viewing loan details
   - Actions performed (edit, status change, note added)
   - Search patterns leading to loan discovery

2. **Search Behavior** 
   - Search terms used in popup
   - Filter combinations
   - Results clicked vs. total results
   - Time between search and action

3. **Feature Usage**
   - Most frequently used extension features
   - User workflow patterns
   - Error rates and failure points
   - Performance metrics (load times, API response times)

4. **Business Intelligence**
   - Peak usage hours
   - Most common loan statuses worked on
   - Geographic patterns (if applicable)
   - Integration points usage (calendar, notes, etc.)

### **Privacy & Compliance**
- Hash sensitive data (loan IDs, borrower info)
- Aggregate data where possible
- Provide opt-out mechanisms
- Regular data purging policies
- GDPR/privacy compliance measures

## 📝 **Session Notes & Resumption Guide**

### **Current Session Status** (End of Day)
**Date**: Current session ending
**Last Completed**: TokenService with comprehensive test suite (25 tests, 81% coverage)
**Ready for**: Phase 1.4 - License & User Initialization

### **🎯 Next Session Immediate Tasks**
1. **LicenseService Implementation** (`src/services/licenseService.ts`)
   - License validation at extension startup
   - AG-Grid Enterprise license integration (user will provide license key)
   - Remote license checking against endpoint
   - License expiration handling

2. **UserService Implementation** (`src/services/userService.ts`)
   - Call `/nano/users?currentOnly=true` API endpoint
   - Extract and store user permissions array
   - User profile management (firstName, lastName, nickName)
   - Session state management

### **🔧 Technical Context for Tomorrow**
- **Project Structure**: Using Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **Testing Setup**: Jest configured with React Testing Library, ts-jest, jsdom
- **Extension Architecture**: Chrome extension with MV3, content scripts, popup, background
- **Current Working Services**: TokenService (fully tested and production-ready)

### **📊 Key API Endpoints Identified**
```bash
# User data endpoint (needs implementation)
curl "https://api.nanolos.com//nano/users?currentOnly=true" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer [token]" \
  -H "accept: application/vnd.api+json"

# Expected response structure documented in checklist above
```

### **🎁 Dependencies to Install Tomorrow**
```bash
# For state management (Zustand)
npm install zustand

# For AG-Grid (when we reach Phase 8)
npm install ag-grid-react ag-grid-enterprise

# For Google Sheets API (Phase 5)
npm install googleapis
```

### **📁 File Structure for Tomorrow's Work**
```
src/services/
├── tokenService.ts ✅ (completed with tests)
├── __tests__/
│   └── tokenService.test.ts ✅ (25 tests passing)
├── licenseService.ts 🔄 (next task)
├── userService.ts 🔄 (next task)
├── configService.ts 📋 (planned)
└── storageService.ts 📋 (planned)
```

### **💡 Important Decisions Made**
1. **AG-Grid Migration**: Dedicated to Phase 8 due to 4,750+ lines complexity
2. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit tests for all services (TokenService pattern established)
3. **User Logging**: Google Sheets for Phase 1, then migrate to dedicated analytics
4. **Architecture**: Service-based with dependency injection pattern

### **🔍 Code Patterns Established**
- **Service Pattern**: Singleton services with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with console.error logging and graceful degradation
- **Testing**: Mock Chrome APIs, localStorage, and external dependencies
- **State Management**: Listeners pattern for reactive updates

### **⚠️ Important Notes for Tomorrow**
1. **AG-Grid License**: User will provide AG-Grid Enterprise license key for integration
2. **API Authentication**: All Nano LOS API calls require Bearer token from TokenService
3. **User Permissions**: Permission array [4, 13, 14, 28, 55, 85, 96, 120, 129, 142, 148, 172, 183, 240, 80] determines feature access
4. **Privacy Compliance**: Hash sensitive data in analytics, implement opt-out mechanisms

### **🚀 Tomorrow's Sprint Goal**
Complete Phase 1.4 (License & User Initialization) by implementing:
- ✅ LicenseService with license validation
- ✅ UserService with API integration
- ✅ Basic error handling and logging
- ✅ Unit tests for both services
- 📋 Update checklist with completed items

### **📞 Questions for User Tomorrow**
1. AG-Grid Enterprise license key for integration
2. Any specific license validation endpoint requirements
3. User permission mapping (what do permission IDs mean?)
4. Google Sheets setup preferences for analytics
